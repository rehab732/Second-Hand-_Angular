<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p> Our e-commerce web application is designed to help users sell their used products with ease. With our platform, users can upload details about their used products, including descriptions, images, and prices. This information is then made available to customers who can log in to the website and purchase these items.</p>
<p> We understand that selling used products can be a hassle, which is why we’ve made it our mission to simplify the process as much as possible. Our platform is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to upload their used products and start selling them right away.</p>
<p>In addition to selling used products, our platform also allows users to donate their items to a specific charity. This feature makes it easy for users to give back to their community while also getting rid of items they no longer need.</p>
<p> Overall, our e-commerce web application is the perfect solution for anyone looking to sell their used products quickly and easily. Whether you’re looking to make some extra cash or simply want to get rid of items you no longer need, our platform has everything you need to get started.
